-- Setup for allocated quantity calculation for inventory stock management testing
-- The schema used is purgo_playground, primarily focusing on f_order table
-- Allocated Quantity: primary_qty + open_qty + shipped_qty - cancel_qty

-- Ensure the environment is set up correctly
-- Typically, libraries like unittest and pyspark.sql are used, but in SQL we directly proceed

/* Test SQL logic for calculating the allocated quantity
   Test case: Ensure presence of relevant records in f_order table and calculation of allocated_qty */

-- Create temporary view to perform tests

-- Performance Test: Measure execution time for allocated_qty calculation for large datasets
-- Exploit SQL analytical capabilities but omitted EXPLAIN for brevity in pure SQL code

-- Validate Delta Lake operations, including MERGE, UPDATE, DELETE
-- For simplicity, this example focuses on core functionalities only

-- Cleanup: Optional step to clean temporary views
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS f_order_temp;

-- Example for testing window function
